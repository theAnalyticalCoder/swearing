The first thing to notice is the sharp decline in swearing from 2011-2013. This is the natural transition from more edgy "old" youtube content to
a more tolerable level so that the kids' parents dont get too upset. There seems to be an equillibrium around 45 swear words per hour. The next change is 
around 2017, the adpocalypse. We see another precipitous decline to a new level of around 25 swear words per hour, enough for adveriser to give th OK.
